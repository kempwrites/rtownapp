FP-demo-app README
==================

Forking from palewire's NICAR15 demo as interactive map for future documentary companion site. Documentation at http://first-news-app.rtfd.org

Will need to add x, y info and map boundaries.

Using raw .csv data that may not include all properties or which may include properties outside boundaries.

Test .csv file laboriously hand-collected from original data source at http://www.claytoncountyga.gov/departments/tax-assessor/real-property-records-search.aspx , saved as .xslx, then combined and exported as .csv. 

Need to add birth, death dates; sale date/price; descendants; burial location for each pioneer, plus deed text, photos.
